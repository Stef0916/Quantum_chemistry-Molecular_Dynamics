# Quantum Chemistry - Molecular Dynamics Projects Repository

This repository serves as a central hub for all my quantum chemistry - molecular dynamics projects. Each project has its own dedicated folder, where you can find more detailed information, code, datasets, and documentation specific to that project.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects available in this repository:

1. [How to run a Molecular Dynamics simulation of protein-ligand complex](https://github.com/Stef0916/computational_chemistry/tree/08d50b2126fec0bc215bb45581c7255ed997b85a/CXCR4-IT1t): This project main focus is the construction of a protein-ligand complex by providing the proper a useful way of assigning a force field to a small organic molecule. All the step previous to the simulation are described in the .md file that you will find inside the foler.
2. [3-Dimensional Correlation](https://github.com/Stef0916/computational_chemistry/tree/08d50b2126fec0bc215bb45581c7255ed997b85a/threeD_correlation): This document provides an overview of the relationship between the variables Θ, α, and J. It discusses the feature engineering process, the derived equation, and the nature of solutions we observed.
